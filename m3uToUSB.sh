# m3uToUSB - Script to convert all the songs in an m3u playlist to mp3 in an output directory
# A bash implementation of my Powershell script, for when bash is available on Windows
#
# Changes:
# v0.2.0
# - Added testImport(), containing the code I used to successfully test importM3U()
# - Changed importM3U() so that it tests for validity before converting, as it takes a LOT of cycles to complete
# - Function also warns user that conversion process will take time
#
# v0.1.0
# - Added multiple function definitions in prep for what's to come
# - Untested version of importM3U() made with a new method I found
# - Added a check for ffmpeg and moreutils (planning on doing parallel processing for increased speed)
#
# v0.0.1
# - Initial commit
#
# v0.2.0, 01 Dec. 2016 16:41 PST
