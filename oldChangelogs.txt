# v1.1.13 - Added deleteFolderProcessor() in prep for file deletion - Made some small changes to debug statements
#
# v1.1.12 - Added $longName for better logging
#
# v1.1.11 - Reverted changes from v1.1.8, existing songs need a new way to be handled with preserveLevel=none - For now, everything will be treated as a delta conversion - I will make a permanenent solution later - ffmpeg gave me 
# an error during testing, so I changed the way it converts - Didn't put the right time in for displayProgress(), fixed now! - Minor adjustments
#
# v1.1.10 - Added displayProgress() so the user sees the actual progress, at specified intervals - Didn't think this warrented changing the minor version, just the patch version
#
# v1.1.9 - Playlist will now place a 'hidden' copy of the current playlist in the output folder - Not used right now, but will likely be implemented later
#
# v1.1.8 - Some usage warnings for user - Changed the way existing files are handled, if preserve=none and overwrite is off - This change effectively stop overwriting same titled songs from different artists when mode is none. 
# Statistically should be 100% effective
#
# v1.1.7 - Small change so that Song titles with a '.' in the name wouldn't get cut off (07 Mz. Hyde.mp3 -> 07 Mz.mp3)
#
# v1.1.6 - Testing shows everything works properly, Windows has some errors though... Assuming everything is fine though - First major release! Everything works!
#
# v1.1.5 - processFailures() is ready for testing
#
# v1.1.4 - Changed some debugging messages to make reading the log easier - Added outputFailures() function, outputs them to a file for debugging purposes - Added determinePath(), basically a condensed version of fileVerifier.sh
#
# v1.1.3 - clean-numbers option is tested and works (now) - Small change to how outputDirectory is evaluated - Added fileTest() to more easily check if file conversion was successful, along with calls
#
# v1.1.2 - Added folderTest() because my current error checking for files was producing too many errors - Implemented above function
#
# v1.1.1 - Functional changes; copying works, but conversion does not
#
# v1.1.0 - Solved all my problems with one line. Added a dependency, but THE SCRIPT WORKS NOW! - All other changes are classified as minor text fixes - Added unlisted option --test-import to test importing and filenames, see 
# testImport() - Didn't add it earlier, but timeout is disabled until I have time to get it working (it was giving me weird errors) - -c option won't edit song titles that don't start with a number - Added delta conversion, once 
# againt a much easier implementation than I remember on Powershell
#
# v1.0.1 - Small changes, forgot to run it through shellcheck - for loop in processArgs() seems to be preventing it from working now, update to this will come tomorrow
#
# v1.0.0 - Ready for release! - Added converterLoop(), which does the actual work. Will find a way to parallel-ize this in a later version - convertSong() will now copy if the song is mp3 or unconvertible, sending a debug message 
# for the latter
#
# v0.5.0 - Added -c | --clean-numbers option to get rid of numbers in output song titles - Created outputFilename(), to be used like win2UnixPath() but for the output name. Handles artist, album, folder checks, and numbers
# 
# v0.4.0 - Added code to remove trailing '/' from prefix and outputFolder, if it exists - Added touchTest() to easily check if user has write permissions for folder - Added error checking for outputFolder, and offer to make 
# folder if non-existent
#
# v0.3.0 - Filled out displayHelp() - processArgs() is ready - convertSong() is ready - Decided to add timeout options and error checking to convertSong()
#
# v0.2.0 - Added testImport(), containing the code I used to successfully test importM3U() - Changed importM3U() so that it tests for validity before converting, as it takes a LOT of cycles to complete - Function also warns user 
# that conversion process will take time
#
# v0.1.0 - Added multiple function definitions in prep for what's to come - Untested version of importM3U() made with a new method I found - Added a check for ffmpeg and moreutils (planning on doing parallel processing for 
# increased speed)
#
# v0.0.1 - Initial commit
