# bash-projects
Scripts, written in Bash, that require version control

Note: Most, if not all of these scripts will require the installation of commonFunctions.sh and packageManagerCF.sh from [my other repo](https://github.com/mrmusic25/linux-pref "Linux-pref"). I would recommend installing it using INSTALL.sh before running any of these (or, you can just link the listed scripts to /usr/share as well).

The minimum version of each required script will be listed in that script's comments, and the minimum version for the whole repo is listed below:

commonFunctions.sh (cF.sh) Minimum Version: 1.7.6
packageManagerCF.sh (pmCF.sh) Minimumm Version: 1.2.0
