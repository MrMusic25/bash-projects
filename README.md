# bash-projects
Scripts, written in Bash, that require version control

## Requirements
Most, if not all of these scripts will require the installation of `commonFunctions.sh` and `packageManagerCF.sh` from [my other repo](https://github.com/mrmusic25/linux-pref "Linux-pref"). I would recommend installing it using `INSTALL.sh` before running any of these (or, you can just link the listed scripts to `/usr/share` as well).

The minimum version of each required script will be listed in that script's comments, and the minimum version for the whole repo is listed below:

`commonFunctions.sh` (cF.sh) Minimum Version: __1.7.6__

`packageManagerCF.sh` (pmCF.sh) Minimum Version: __1.2.0__
